The Bar & Restaurant Finder is a web-based map application that helps users easily locate bars and restaurants in any selected city and view the list of alcohol brands they serve. It is built using Leaflet with OpenStreetMap for the interactive map and the Nominatim API to fetch city locations. When a user enters a city name, the map automatically zooms into that city and displays markers for all the bars and restaurants available there. Each bar entry is linked with its latitude, longitude, and a customized menu of brands such as Royal Stag, Jack Daniels, Kingfisher, and more. Clicking on a marker opens a popup showing the barâ€™s name, type, city, and the complete list of available brands, making it easy for users to know where they can find their preferred drinks. The application is flexible and can be expanded with more cities, more bars, and additional brand data. Since it uses OpenStreetMap, it is free to use and does not require an API key, though it can also be extended with route mapping or connected to a live database for real-time brand availability. In short, this tool combines a city search with an interactive map and brand menus to give users a complete bar and restaurant guide in one place.
